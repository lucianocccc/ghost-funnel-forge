- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (if available)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **24 hours**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report
- **72 hours**: We will provide an initial assessment
- **7 days**: We will provide a detailed response with next steps

### 4. Disclosure Process

1. We will investigate and validate the vulnerability
2. We will develop and test a fix
3. We will release a security patch
4. We will publicly disclose the vulnerability after the fix is deployed
